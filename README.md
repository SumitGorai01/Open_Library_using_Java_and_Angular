### Overview
The project is a dynamic, interactive web-based library designed to enhance user engagement and knowledge retention. It allows users to register, access a wide range of free books, and participate in quizzes on diverse subjects. The application was developed using Java for the back-end and Angular for the front-end, ensuring a robust and responsive user experience.

### Key Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
    - **User Registration**: Users can sign up by providing necessary details like name, email, and password etc.
    - **User Authentication**: Implemented secure login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users. This ensures that only registered users can access specific parts of the website.

2. **User Authorization**:
    - Different levels of access control were established, ensuring that users only have access to the sections and functionalities relevant to their roles (e.g.,  users vs. admin).

3. **Book Access**:
    - **Browse and Search**: Users can browse through a catalog of free books, with options to search for specific titles, authors, or genres.
    - **Read Online**: Integrated a feature that allows users to read books directly on the website, enhancing accessibility.

4. **Interactive Quizzes**:
    - **Quiz Participation**: Users can take quizzes on a variety of subjects. These quizzes are designed to boost engagement and help users retain knowledge.
    - **Quiz Results**: Immediate feedback on quiz results, with correct answers provided to facilitate learning.

5. **Secure Data Exchange**:
    - Implemented RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the front-end and back-end. This ensures seamless data exchange, maintaining a smooth and responsive user experience.

### Technical Implementation

#### Back-End (Java):
- **Framework**: Spring Boot was used to develop the back-end services, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **Database**: Utilized a relational database (e.g., MySQL ) to store user data, book details, and quiz information.
- **Security**: Implemented Spring Security for user authentication and authorization, including role-based access control.
- **APIs**: Developed RESTful APIs to handle user registration, login, book retrieval, and quiz management.

#### Front-End (Angular):
- **UI/UX Design**: Designed a user-friendly interface with Angular, ensuring responsive design principles for optimal viewing on various devices.
- **Components**: Created modular components for different functionalities, such as book lists, quiz interfaces, user profiles, and registration forms.
- **State Management**: Used services and state management techniques to maintain a consistent user experience across different components.
- **HTTP Client**: Utilized Angular's HTTP client module to interact with the back-end APIs, handling data fetching, posting, and updating operations.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Engagement**: The interactive quizzes and easy access to a variety of books keep users engaged and motivated to use the platform regularly.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure data security, while the use of scalable technologies ensures that the platform can handle growing user bases.
- **Seamless Experience**: Efficient communication between the front-end and back-end, facilitated by RESTful APIs, provides users with a smooth and responsive experience.

### Conclusion
This web-based library project demonstrates the effective integration of Java and Angular to create a dynamic, interactive platform. By focusing on user engagement, security, and seamless data exchange, the project provides a valuable resource for users looking to expand their knowledge through accessible, free resources.
